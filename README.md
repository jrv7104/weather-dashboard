This is a weather forecast website, and it was quite possibly the toughest assignment. I was able to get the current day weather to work, but getting the five day was tougher, especially since I figured out what to do late shortly before the deadline. Getting the five-day forecast to work later is a possibiity, but a struggle to do it before deadline now. This is a learning experience not only in regards to getting the page to work, but how to recover after a tough defeat as well. For the most part I've fared well in homework assignments before deadlines, but not really this one, so my will to recover after a disappointing showing will be challenged this and next week.
