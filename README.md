This is a weather forecast website, and it was quite possibly the toughest assignment. I was able to get the current day weather to work, but getting the five day was tougher, especially since I figured out what to do late shortly before the deadline. Getting the five-day forecast to work later was tough, and while I was able to do it for the most part, I wasn't able to get the dates for that section to work correctly. For the most part I've fared well in homework assignments before deadlines, but it was kind of disappointing to not be able to design it as well as I'd like and not have every little element the assignment asked present, especially having search results saved. An updated version of this assignment is a possibility.
